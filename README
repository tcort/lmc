LMC stands for Little Man Computer. It was created in 1965 by Dr. Stuart
Madnick as a way to illustrate the basic features of a programmable computer.

This repository contains an implementation of a virtual LMC as well as an
assembler to compile simple programs into byte code that can be executed
by the virtual machine.

It's 80% there, but some finishing touches are still needed. See the TODO file
for details about my future plans.
